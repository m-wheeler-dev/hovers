<p>A JavaScript "for" loop will create 400 boxes within the container.</p>
<p>Hover over the boxes and JavaScript will change its color using math randomization and an array of color options.</p>
<p>The color will begin to fade when the cursor exits the box.</p>
<p>The same effect was given to the letters, but instead of fading back to gray they will remain a cyan color unless hovered over again.</p>
